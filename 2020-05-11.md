## Abstract
Agents that can make better use of computation, experience, time, and memory can solve a greater range of problems more effectively. 

A crucial ingredient for managing such finite resources is intelligently chosen **abstract representations**. 

But, how do abstractions facilitate problem solving under limited resources? What makes an abstraction useful? 

To answer such questions, we review several trends in recent reinforcement-learning research that provide insight into how abstractions interact with learning and decision making. During learning, abstraction can guide exploration and generalization as well as facilitate efficient tradeoffsâ€”e.g.,
time spent learning versus the quality of a solution. 

During computation, good abstractions provide simplified models for computation while also preserving relevant information about
decision-theoretic quantities. 

These features of abstraction are 
- not only key for scaling up artificial problem solving, 
- but can also shed light on what pressures shape the use of abstract representations in humans and other organisms.
